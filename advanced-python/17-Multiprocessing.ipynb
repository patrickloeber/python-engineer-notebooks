    "\n",

    "A race condition happened here. A race condition occurs when two or more processes or threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. In our example the two processes have to read the shared value, increase it by 1, and write it back into the shared variable. If this happens at the same time, the two processes read the same value, increase it and write it back. Thus, both processes write the same increased value back into the shared object, and the value was not increased by 2. See https://www.python-engineer.com/learn/advancedpython16_threading/ for a detailed explanation of race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Avoid race conditions with `Locks`\n",
    "A lock (also known as mutex) is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many processes/threads of execution. A Lock has two states: **locked** and **unlocked**. \n",
    "If the state is locked, it does not allow other concurrent processes/threads to enter this code section until the state is unlocked again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two functions are important:\n",
    "- `lock.acquire()` : This will lock the state and block\n",
    "- `lock.release()` : This will unlock the state again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: You should always release the block again after it was acquired!\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example the critical code section where the shared variable is read and increased is now locked. This prevents the second process from modyfing the shared object at the same time. Not much has changed in our code. All new changes are commented in the code below."
