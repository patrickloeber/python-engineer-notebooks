    "Notice that in the above example, the 2 threads should increment the value by 1, so 2 increment operations are performed. But why is the end value 1 and not 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Race condition\n",
    "A race condition happened here. A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time. Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. In our case, the first thread accesses the `database_value` (0) and stores it in a local copy. It then increments it (`local_copy` is now 1). With our `time.sleep()` function that just simulates some time consuming operations, the programm will swap to the second thread in the meantime. This will also retrieve the current `database_value` (still 0) and increment the `local_copy` to 1. Now both threads have a local copy with value 1, so both will write the 1 into the global `database_value`. This is why the end value is 1 and not 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Avoid race conditions with `Locks`\n",
    "A lock (also known as mutex) is a synchronization mechanism for enforcing limits on access to a resource in an environment where there are many threads of execution. A Lock has two states: **locked** and **unlocked**. \n",
    "If the state is locked, it does not allow other concurrent threads to enter this code section until the state is unlocked again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two functions are important:\n",
    "- `lock.acquire()` : This will lock the state and block\n",
    "- `lock.release()` : This will unlock the state again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: You should always release the block again after it was acquired!\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example the critical code section where database values are retrieved and modified is now locked. This prevents the second thread from modyfing the global data at the same time. Not much has changed in our code. All new changes are commented in the code below."

    "- `q.get()` : Remove and return the first item. By default, it blocks until the item is available.\n",
    "- `q.put(item)` : Puts element at the end of the queue. By default, it blocks until a free slot is available.\n",

When items are available, they are processed (i.e. just printed here), and then `q.task_done()` tells the queue that processing is complete. In the main thread, 10 **daemon** threads are created. This means that they automatically die when the main thread dies, and thus the worker method and infinite loop is no longer invoked. Then the queue is filled with items and the worker method can continue with available items. At the end `q.join()` is necessary to block the main thread until all items have been gotten and proccessed."
